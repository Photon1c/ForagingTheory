# Foraging Algorithms: Buffet Race Experiment

This project is an interactive simulation and base template for exploring **foraging theory** and advanced AI resource management concepts, rendered with React and Three.js.

## What is Foraging Theory?
Foraging theory is a branch of behavioral ecology that studies how agents (animals, robots, or AI) search for and consume resources in a shared environment. It explores questions like:
- How do agents distribute themselves among food patches?
- When should an agent leave a depleted patch for a richer one?
- How do competition and cooperation affect resource intake?

These concepts are highly relevant to AI, robotics, and resource management systems.

## About This Project
- **Base Template:** This is a foundational template for building and experimenting with foraging theory algorithms in a 3D environment.
- **In Development:** Advanced foraging concepts and algorithms are actively being developed and will be added in future updates.
- **Instructions:** The in-app instructions also note that this is a base template and that advanced features are in progress.

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open your browser:**
   Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Deployment
To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
The output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.
